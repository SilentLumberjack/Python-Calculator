# Implementatin of a simple calculator in Python

## Why this project exists

When I mastered basic python skills and some more, I decided to create GUI project to get accomplished and working program.
SO, firts thing that I sought about was a calculator. To realize this idea I started learning a standard GUI library for Python named Tkinter.
This technology allowed me to put my idea into practice.

## What is the main idea of this calculator

The main logic of this calculator is to store two numbers and one math operation in main window at the same time, like(2+4 or 12\*25)
If user wants to cuntinue calcululation we have to calculate currently stored expression, take a result and continue accept input.
For example user types (2+5) and then user wants to multiply this by 5, when user clicks a multiply button, we calculate current expression,
and multiply the result by 5: (2+5) -> (7\*) -> (7\*5)

## Is there some features in this program?

Yes, I would say so. I defined a lot of helpful functions and made this calculator kind of anti-vandal. You can press whatever you want and you will not brake the program.
I used a lot of try/exept statements to protect program from invalid user's inputes and actions. Also, you will get warning massage on the main screen in case of division by zero or similar cases. Some additional functionality like division number by 1, negation of number, squaring the number or getting square root of a number also included :)
